## Usage
- Simply execute `python main.py` for a brief usage summary of SZZ++. Read the [report/manual](manual.pdf) for more details.

## Dependencies
- Some steps depend on bunch of Python packages like [`gitpython`](https://gitpython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/), `psycopg2`, etc.; Use `pip` to easily install them. For example, `sudo pip gitpython` and `sudo pip psycopg2` should do the trick.
- Tested with Python2.

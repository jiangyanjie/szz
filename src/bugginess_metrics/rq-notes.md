## Research Questions:

1. Are some AST nodetypes more defect-prone than others? (DONE)
    -- TODO Explain briefly
    1.1 sub question: how does this vary across projects? (TODO)

2. Within a project, is the defectiveness of AST nodetype instances skewed? (DONE)
    -- TODO Explain briefly
    2.1 sub question: is this observed phenomenon occuring by chance?
    
3. Do some AST nodes become defective again and again?
    -- TODO Explain briefly
    -- If we track all the distinct AST nodes over the project's history and plot a lorenz curve for the cumulative number of defects seen in them over time, then we can answer.
